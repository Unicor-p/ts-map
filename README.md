## About

This project are written on C#. This app are used to exctact datas from the game file and export as Json files or Png files

The main purpose about it, it's the map extraction. It's can create image of the game map.

You can use it on the opensource map like OpenLayer.

It's made for SCS Software game, especially Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator

I'm decide to rework full original project. Now you can use it from a console and soon from a new graphical interface.
